# Next.js Patterns for React Server Components (App Router)

A few examples that explore different patterns for interleaving react server components (RSCs) with client side components (`"use client";`) in Next.js.

Understanding these patterns, alongside server actions, helps one compose components in a cleaner manner. It also helps to create better component interfaces, both client components that accept RSCs (pattern #1), and RSCs that accept client components (patterns #2 and #3).

_Except for the first pattern, I came across these while experimenting but have not found it in upstream docs. Please add a link (pull-request) if you do._
